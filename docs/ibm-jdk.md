# IBM JDK
The IBM JDK is the defualt used with Liberty profile. You do not need to change the manifest.yml file if you want to use the IBM JDK, but you can insert ```jvm: ibmjdk``` into the manifest.yml and this will also run the IBM JDK. 

If you would prefer to use the Open JDK then please read [Open JDK](open-jdk.md).
